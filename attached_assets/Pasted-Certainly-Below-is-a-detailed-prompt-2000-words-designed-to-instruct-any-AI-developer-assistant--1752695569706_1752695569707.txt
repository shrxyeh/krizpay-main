	‚Ä¢	QRScanner.js:
	‚Ä¢	Use react-qr-reader for live scanning.
	‚Ä¢	Distinguish scanned QR as:
	‚Ä¢	upi:// ‚Üí Route to UPI payment flow.
	‚Ä¢	Blockchain address ‚Üí Route to crypto payment flow.
	‚Ä¢	CryptoPaymentForm.js:

‚∏ª

2Ô∏è‚É£ Backend Development (Node.js with Express.js):

2.1. Backend Setup:
	‚Ä¢	Setup Express.js backend inside Replit.
	‚Ä¢	Endpoints:
	‚Ä¢	/api/payment-intent ‚Äì Creates crypto-to-INR payment intents.
	‚Ä¢	/api/upi-payment-status/:intentId ‚Äì Polls for UPI payout status.
	‚Ä¢	/api/transactions ‚Äì Stores and retrieves all transactions.
	‚Ä¢	/api/admin/summary ‚Äì Provides admin stats and balances.
	‚Ä¢	/api/user/kyc ‚Äì Stores minimal KYC information.

2.2. Payment Intent Logic:
	‚Ä¢	When UPI VPA is scanned:
	‚Ä¢	Frontend calls /api/payment-intent.
	‚Ä¢	Backend generates:
	‚Ä¢	Payment ID.
	‚Ä¢	Amount in INR.
	‚Ä¢	Linked UPI VPA.
	‚Ä¢	Return UPI Intent URL (or QR code).
	‚Ä¢	Store as pending payment in MongoDB.

2.3. Transaction Monitoring:
	‚Ä¢	For on-chain crypto deposits:
	‚Ä¢	Monitor via:
	‚Ä¢	Etherscan API for Ethereum-like chains.
	‚Ä¢	Flow Access Nodes for Flow deposits.
	‚Ä¢	When transaction confirmed:
	‚Ä¢	Trigger UPI payout (simulate via API or logs).
	‚Ä¢	Update payment status in DB.

2.4. Real-Time Pricing:
	‚Ä¢	Use Chainlink/Coingecko APIs.
	‚Ä¢	Fetch prices every 15 seconds.
	‚Ä¢	Protect using a rate volatility guard:
	‚Ä¢	Block if price fluctuates >5% within 60 seconds.
	‚Ä¢	API returns error: volatility-high for client warning.

2.5. Security:
	‚Ä¢	Protect admin routes with JWT.
	‚Ä¢	Store sensitive configs in Replit‚Äôs Secrets Manager.
	‚Ä¢	Use HTTPS for external APIs.

‚∏ª

3Ô∏è‚É£ Database:
	‚Ä¢	Use MongoDB Atlas (recommended) or Replit‚Äôs built-in database.
	‚Ä¢	Collections:
	‚Ä¢	users ‚Äì Stores email, wallet address (minimal KYC).
	‚Ä¢	transactions ‚Äì All payment transactions with statuses.
	‚Ä¢	payment_intents ‚Äì Active crypto-to-INR requests.
	‚Ä¢	admin_stats ‚Äì Liquidity pool balances, stats.

‚∏ª

4Ô∏è‚É£ Wallet Integration:
	‚Ä¢	For Ethereum, BSC, Polygon:
	‚Ä¢	Use ethers.js for:
	‚Ä¢	Reading user balance.
	‚Ä¢	Sending crypto transactions.
	‚Ä¢	Monitoring transaction status.
	‚Ä¢	For Flow blockchain:
	‚Ä¢	Use @onflow/fcl for wallet connection and transaction handling.
	‚Ä¢	For WalletConnect/Blocto:
	‚Ä¢	Use their respective SDKs if available.

Ensure:
	‚Ä¢	Auto chain detection.
	‚Ä¢	Error handling on chain switch failure.
	‚Ä¢	Store connected wallet in global context.

‚∏ª

5Ô∏è‚É£ Admin Dashboard:

	‚Ä¢	Displays:
	‚Ä¢	Live transaction records.
	‚Ä¢	Total crypto collected.
	‚Ä¢	Total INR payouts.
	‚Ä¢	Failed transactions.
	‚Ä¢	Graphs of transaction volume over time.
	‚Ä¢	Create /admin route in frontend.

‚∏ª

6Ô∏è‚É£ Security Considerations:

	‚Ä¢	DO NOT use centralized crypto exchanges for UPI settlement‚Äîsimulate payout via APIs.
	‚Ä¢	Always provide real-time feedback via UI for any user-facing actions.
	‚Ä¢	Ensure all critical flows (payments, QR scanning, transactions) work even under limited network conditions.

‚∏ª

Once this project is complete, KrizPay will serve as a functional, scalable prototype for crypto-to-UPI and blockchain payments, capable of being scaled into a production merchant payment gateway.
